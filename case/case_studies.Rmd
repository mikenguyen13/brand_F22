Quaker bought it for \$1.7 billion and sold it to Triarc for \$300 million four years later. Can we understand Quaker's problems and advise Triarc's Mike Weinstein on how to reverse a trendy brand that was out of fashion with its sales decline.

This case follows Snapple's 26-year history. It chronicles the brand's genesis, its struggle to prevent extinction at birth, its victory, a \$1.4 billion tragedy, and its attempt to rebuild.

It was the first alternative beverage to challenge Coke and Pepsi. It wasn't a soda, therefore it was innovative. Using glass bottles and a hot fill procedure, Snapple was made without preservatives. The outcome was "Best Stuff on Earth" product and brand. Snapple has a joyful, quirky image.

4.  Snapple's brand image and equity sources.

5.  Quaker's mistake: What did they do wrong?
